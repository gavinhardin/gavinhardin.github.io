This is the repository for my [personal website](https://gavinhardin.me) hosted through GitHub Pages, serving as a 
resume/portfolio and repository for my interests.

## Credits
Many thanks to [Nathan Randecker](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle) for the Particle Jekyll 
theme I've used as the base for this website, and to [Matteo Bruni](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles) 
for the tsParticles library used to create the particle background effect on the main page.
